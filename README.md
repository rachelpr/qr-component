### My process
1. First I wrote the index.html, using semantic HTML tags as much as possible
2. From here I wrote the basis of my layout.css stylesheet, with the known styles
3. After this I spent most of my time re-configuring the styles from the browser dev tools as this helped me play around until I found the right one.
4. I then showed my solution and the mock-ups to other people for a critical eye that wasn't my own

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Downside to using the dev tools to style is accidentally forgetting to take the stylesheet from the dev console and apply them to your project stylesheet

### Useful resources

- [Aligning Items in a Flex Container](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - MDN resource for aligning items with Flexbox, always a good read! 
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - A good resource for mastering the Chrome DevTools
